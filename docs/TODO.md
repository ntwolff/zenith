## 📚 Ongoing Research

### 📈 Amazon Science: fraud-dataset-benchmark 

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/amazon-science/fraud-dataset-benchmark)

The Fraud Dataset Benchmark (FDB) is a compilation of publicly available datasets relevant to fraud detection. The FDB aims to cover a wide variety of fraud detection tasks, from card not present transaction fraud to bot attacks, malicious traffic, loan risk, and content moderation. The Python-based data loaders from FDB provide dataset loading, standardized train-test splits, and performance evaluation metrics.

### 🏦 SDV [Synthetic Data Vault]

[GitHub Link](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV)

The Synthetic Data Vault Project was first created at MIT's Data to AI Lab in 2016. SDV is the largest ecosystem for synthetic data generation & evaluation, home to multiple libraries that support synthetic data. SDMetrics is an open source Python library for evaluating tabular synthetic data, allowing you to compare synthetic data against real data using a variety of metrics, generate visual reports, and share them with your team.
